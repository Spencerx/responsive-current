responsive-current
==================

A place to stash the code to make our current site responsive. Once the minimum is up a running, I want to optimize and experiment.

##TO-DO:
* Reduce JS calls
* Make one sprite png for any graphics on page
* Smooth out the menu (CSS transitions?)
* Make Search bigger and not jump to anchor
